abstract: "Cognitive control allows us to think and behave flexibly based on our context\
  \ and goals. At the heart of theories of cognitive control is a control representation\
  \ that enables the same input to produce different outputs contingent on contextual\
  \ factors. In this review, we focus on an important property of the control representation's\
  \ neural code: its representational dimensionality. Dimensionality of a neural representation\
  \ balances a basic separability/generalizability trade-off in neural computation.\
  \ We will discuss the implications of this trade-off for cognitive control. We will\
  \ then briefly review current neuroscience findings regarding the dimensionality\
  \ of control representations in the brain, particularly the prefrontal cortex. We\
  \ conclude by highlighting open questions and crucial directions for future research."
