 abstract = {A tennis player planning the next stroke has to consider various
pieces of information: the type of stroke, the trajectory of the
incoming ball, and where to hit the ball. Here, by decoding
electroencephalography signals while participants executed
simple, rule-based actions, we found that such different,
actionrelevant aspects are integrated within a unified,
conjunctive representation rather than being processed in a
piecemeal manner. Furthermore, the strength of conjunctive
representations is a highly robust predictor of how quickly
actions are executed. Human-level theories and recent
single-cell evidence from animal models suggest that conjunctive
representations are a necessary condition for successful action
selection. Our results provide direct evidence in humans that is
consistent with this hypothesis. People can use abstract rules
to flexibly configure and select actions for specific
situations, yet how exactly rules shape actions toward specific
sensory and/or motor requirements remains unclear. Both research
from animal models and human-level theories of action control
point to the role of highly integrated, conjunctive
representations, sometimes referred to as event files. These
representations are thought to combine rules with other,
goal-relevant sensory and motor features in a nonlinear manner
and represent a necessary condition for action selection.
However, so far, no methods exist to track such representations
in humans during action selection with adequate temporal
resolution. Here, we applied time-resolved representational
similarity analysis to the spectral-temporal profiles of
electroencephalography signals while participants performed a
cued, rule-based action selection task. In two experiments, we
found that conjunctive representations were active throughout
the entire selection period and were functionally dissociable
from the representation of constituent features. Specifically,
the strength of conjunctions was a highly robust predictor of
trial-by-trial variability in response times and was selectively
related to an important behavioral indicator of conjunctive
representations, the so-called partial-overlap priming pattern.
These results provide direct evidence for conjunctive
representations as critical precursors of action selection in
humans.},
