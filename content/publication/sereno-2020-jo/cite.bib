 abstract = {Humans have a unique ability to perceive shape in different ways.
Although we naturally estimate objective (physical) shape in our
daily interactions with the world, we are also capable of
estimating projective (retinal) shape, especially when attempting
to accurately draw objects and scenes. In four experiments, we
demonstrated robust effects of 3D context on shape perception.
Using a binocular stereo paradigm, we presented rectangular
surfaces of varying widths alone or embedded in a polyhedron. We
investigated how context, judgment type, and angle affected width
estimates. We found that the presence of even a small amount of
3D context aids objective judgments but hinders projective
judgments, whereas a lack of context had the opposite effect.
Context facilitated objective shape assessments by improving
estimates of surface orientation. These results demonstrate that
the typical presence of 3D context aids shape perception (shape
constancy) while simultaneously making the projective judgments
necessary for realistic drawing more difficult.},
