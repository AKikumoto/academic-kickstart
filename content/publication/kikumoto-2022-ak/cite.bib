 abstract = {Action selection appears to rely on conjunctive representations
that nonlinearly integrate task-relevant features. Here, we
tested a corollary of this hypothesis: that such representations
are also intricately involved during attempts to stop an action-a
key aspect of action regulation. We tracked both conjunctive
representations and those of constituent rule, stimulus, or
response features through trial-by-trial representational
similarity analysis of the electroencephalogram signal in a
combined rule-selection and stop-signal paradigm. Across two
experiments with student participants (N = 57), we found (a) that
the strength of decoded conjunctive representations prior to the
stop signal uniquely predicted trial-by-trial stopping success
(Experiment 1) and (b) that these representations were
selectively suppressed following the onset of the stop signal
(Experiments 1 and 2). We conclude that conjunctive
representations are key to successful action execution and
therefore need to be suppressed when an intended action is no
longer appropriate.},
