abstract: "Action selection appears to rely on conjunctive representations that nonlinearly
  integrate task-relevant features. Here, we tested a corollary of this hypothesis:
  that such representations are also intricately involved during attempts to stop
  an action-a key aspect of action regulation. We tracked both conjunctive representations
  and those of constituent rule, stimulus, or response features through trial-by-trial
  representational similarity analysis of the electroencephalogram signal in a combined
  rule-selection and stop-signal paradigm. Across two experiments with student participants
  (N = 57), we found (a) that the strength of decoded conjunctive representations
  prior to the stop signal uniquely predicted trial-by-trial stopping success (Experiment
  1) and (b) that these representations were selectively suppressed following the
  onset of the stop signal (Experiments 1 and 2). We conclude that conjunctive representations
  are key to successful action execution and therefore need to be suppressed when
  an intended action is no longer appropriate."
