abstract: "Prominent theories of action control propose that conjunctive representations, which integrate task-relevant features in a nonlinear manner, are critical for successful action control. Thus, in order to stop an initiated action, which is a key aspect of self-control, conjunctive representations should be the primary target of the stopping process. We tested this hypothesis by combining a rule-based action selection task with the stop-signal paradigm. Participants selected actions based on abstract stimulus-response rules and occasionally received a stop-signal as a prompt to halt the intended action. Using time-resolved representational similarity analysis of the EEG signal, we decoded both orthogonal, constituent action-relevant representations (rules, stimuli, and responses) and conjunctions of these features in a time-resolved manner and on the level of single trials. In Exp. 1, where a short stop-signal interval (100 ms) ensured high stopping success, simple action-relevant features and their nonlinear conjunction were robustly expressed in the EEG signal. Importantly, the conjunctive representation was selectively suppressed on stop trials. In Exp. 2, an adaptive staircase targeting a stopping success of 50%. Here, conjunctions were selectively suppressed on successful stop trials compared to both go and failed stop trials. Moreover, the strength of conjunctive representations at the time of the stop-signal uniquely predicted stopping failures. Combined, these results clarify that the stopping process does not just target motor output representations. Rather, conjunctive representations seem to be critical for selecting a specific action and for that reason also need to be suppressed by the stopping process in order to cancel intended actions. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest."
