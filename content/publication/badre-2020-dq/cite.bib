 abstract = {Cognitive control allows us to think and behave flexibly based on
our context and goals. At the heart of theories of cognitive
control is a control representation that enables the same input
to produce different outputs contingent on contextual factors. In
this review, we focus on an important property of the control
representation's neural code: its representational
dimensionality. Dimensionality of a neural representation
balances a basic separability/generalizability trade-off in
neural computation. We will discuss the implications of this
trade-off for cognitive control. We will then briefly review
current neuroscience findings regarding the dimensionality of
control representations in the brain, particularly the prefrontal
cortex. We conclude by highlighting open questions and crucial
directions for future research.},
