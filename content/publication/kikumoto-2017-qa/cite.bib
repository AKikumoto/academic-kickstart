 abstract = {Selection and preparation of action plans (task sets) is often
assumed to occur in working memory (WM). Yet, the absence of
consistent evidence that WM capacity and task selection
efficiency is correlated raises questions about the functional
relationship between these two aspects of executive control. We
used the EEG-derived contralateral delay activity (CDA) to index
the WM load of task sets. In Experiment 1, we found a CDA set
size effect (2 vs. 4 stimulus-response [S-R] rules) for high-WM,
but not for low-WM, individuals when S-R sets were novel. In
contrast, when only four task sets were presented throughout the
experiment, we observed a sustained yet set size-independent use
of WM for high-WM participants. Moreover, Experiment 2 showed an
increase of the CDA in situations with task conflict, and this
effect was larger the more that participants experienced RT
conflict effects. Combined, these results indicate that even
highly familiar S-R settings are maintained in WM, albeit in a
compressed manner, presumably through cues to long-term memory
representations. Finally, participants with low-WM capacity
represented even familiar tasks in a load-dependent manner,
suggesting that the establishment of effective retrieval
structures itself is a capacity-limited process.},
