 abstract = {For flexible goal-directed behavior, prioritizing and selecting
a specific action among multiple candidates is often important.
Working memory has long been assumed to play a role in
prioritization and planning, while bridging cross-temporal
contingencies during action selection. However, studies of
working memory have mostly focused on memory for single
components of an action plan, such as a rule or a stimulus,
rather than management of all of these elements during planning.
Therefore, it is not known how post-encoding prioritization and
selection operate on the entire profile of representations for
prospective actions. Here, we assessed how such control
processes unfold over action representations, highlighting the
role of conjunctive representations that nonlinearly integrate
task-relevant features during maintenance and prioritization of
action plans. For each trial, participants prepared two
independent rule-based actions simultaneously, then they were
retro-cued to select one as their response. Prior to the start
of the trial, one rule-based action was randomly assigned to be
high priority by cueing that it was more likely to be tested. We
found that both full action plans were maintained as conjunctive
representations during action preparation, regardless of
priority. However, during output selection, the conjunctive
representation of the high priority action plan was more
enhanced and readily selected as an output. Further, the
strength of the high priority conjunctive representation was
associated with behavioral interference when the low priority
action was tested. Thus, multiple alternate upcoming actions
were maintained as integrated representations and served as the
target of post-encoding attentional selection mechanisms to
prioritize and select an action from within working memory.},
