I am interested in studying neural mechanisms that support cognitive control and working memory for flexible behavior. I use a range of methods including, EEG, eye-tracking, fMRI, and computational modeling.

I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at Brown University(PI:[David Badre](https://sites.brown.edu/badrelab/)) and the RIKEN Center for Brain Science (PI:[Kazuhisa Shibata](https://shibatalab.riken.jp/)). I completed my Ph.D at University of Oregon with [Ulrich Mayr](https://blogs.uoregon.edu/cognitivedynamics/home/). During my Ph.D program, I visited the Max Planck Institute of Human Development in Berlin to join [Cognitive and Neuronal Dynamic of Memory Across Lifespan](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/research/research-centers/lip/projects/concluded/conmem) team.
